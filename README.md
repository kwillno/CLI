# Introduction

This is a repository for my own CLI(Command Line Interfaces). I am using the click python library for handling of arguments.  

# Setup

To start using this repo yourself, clone it into your home-directory and copy the contents of aliases.txt into your .bash_aliases file. 

# Usage

After adding aliases the commands can be used from any directory:

´´´
$newton -eq 4*x**2 -3 -deq 8*x -x0 2
x=0.8660254037844387
